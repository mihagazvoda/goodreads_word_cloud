# About

This is a project to create a word cloud from the topics I read about. Data used is from my Goodreads account.    
I reused some code from Mara Averick's post [Goodreads Part 2: rvesting descriptions](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/10/goodreads-part-2/). Thanks!

## Usage
Run `drake::r_make()` to run or update the whole work flow. Replace `start_url` in `R/constants.R` with appropriate one and check how many pages of books you have. For that, use incognito mode - don't be logged in.
